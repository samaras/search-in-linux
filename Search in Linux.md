# How to search for files in Linux

### Introduction

This guide was created to help you understand how to search for files in a Linux system. The tutorial was based on a Linux Mint 18.3 installation.
Linux uses different commands to help you look for files using regular expressions. Imagine looking for a file, but don't dont remember 
much except a small part of the name of the file. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this guide you'll need the following:

- Desktop/laptop/server with Ubuntu/Linux Mint installed or any other Linux distribution really.

## Step 1 â€” Using the grep command

Grep is used to search for characters inside files. It also has support for regular expressions. The family of grep commands include the 
following commands: grep, egrep, fgrep.
egrep and grep are more or less the same with just minor differences. fgrep uses fixed strings to extract text from files. Grep can also take in input from the standard input.

Search for pattern in files:
```
$ grep [options] pattern files
```

The commands will read each line one at time.

* `\*` will match any character
* `?` or `.`  will only match a single character
* `[xxx]` will match a range of characters 
* `\x` will escape characters such as ? or \ which are used in other regexp
* `^pattern` will match anything that starts with pattern 
* `$pattern` will match anything that ends with pattern


Search recursively for pattern in the home directory: 
```
$ grep -r pattern /home
```

Display the _find_ commands in your bash_history with the following:

```command
grep -a find .bash_history
```

You'll see the following output:

```
[Output]

find /home -size +10000k
man find
man find > find.txt
gedit find.txt
find -type f -mtime -1 -print

```

Now transition to the next step by telling the reader what's next.

## The find command

The find command is a slow but reliable option if you are searching for a file in your system. If the file exists, find is more likely to find it eventually. It has the following format:

`find [path] [options]`

$ find /home/tom -name 'index*'
Find can used to search for files in choosen directories. You can specify a list of directories to search in. 
The find command can also search using the following criteria: 
* Search by size of the file
* Search by name of the file 
* Search by permission of the files -
* Search by group the file owner belongs to -gid 
* Search by the owner of the file -uid & -user
* Search by type    -type
    The possible arguments to -type are b{block device}, c {character device}, d {directory}, p {named pipe}, f {regular file}, l {symbolic link}


Find files names that start with "FB":
```
find /home -name 'FB*'
```

Find files that are larger than 10 MB in the home folder:
```
find /home -size +10000k
```

Find files by the type of permission allowed:
```
$ find /home -perm 
```

Find files by the group of the owner of the file belongs to:

```
$ find -user root
```
<$>[warning]
**Warning:** The -user option will only work if the user exists and is not removed. Use the -uid argument to reference the user. 
<$>

The -maxdepth levels option is used to limit how far deep the find command will search in the subdirectories.

The -exec options allows you to execute other commands on the files found. The following will remove any .tmp files found in the **home** directory.

```
find /home -name "*.tmp" -exec rm {} \;
```

To list files of a certain type which have also been accessed in the past 24 hours you can run the follwoing command:

```
find /home -mtime -1 \! -type d
```

The -type options specifies the type of file. In this case a directory. You add a \! to list any file type except a directory. 


## Locate and the whereis command

The `whereis` command is used to search for files in the systems path. 

```
whereis elixir 
```


The `locate` command is for finding files using just a simple string or filename. The command assumes you have called the `updatedb`. The `updatedb` command creates or updates a database file which has all the files attached to the linux root directory. Locate will use this database to give you the location of the file.


Find all instances of filename:
```
$ locate filename
```

## ls command

The `ls` command is used to list the contents of the current working directory. Its one of the most used linux commands. 

The most common options used with `ls` are the -a and -l options.
The `ls -a` command is used to list all files including hidden files, while the `ls -l` command is for listing all files with all their size, permissions and ownership information. You can also use special characters to abbreviate file names, this is called 'globbing'. It should not be confused with regular expressions which is used in the grep command. 

```
ls -l filename
```

To list all text files in the directory run:
```
$ ls *.txt
```

The following will list any file that has a number as its name including the extension. If you omit the last star at the end, only 
files ending with numbers will be listed e.g `ls *[0-9]`.  
```
$ ls *[0123456789]*
$ ls *[0-9]*
```

I got the following output on my home folder:

```

```

```
$ ls *[-a-z][0-9]*
```

```
ls FB_IMG_1*[0-9]*.jpg
```

I got the following output on my home folder:

```
[secondary_label Output]

FB_IMG_1450904477927.jpg
FB_IMG_1458068934007.jpg
```
I could also have gotten the same output using an asterik representing any zero or more characters after the **'FB_IMG_'** string. 

```
ls FB_IMG_*
```

You can escape characters with a slash "\"
```
ls *\?*  
```


## Nugget

You can search the manual pages for help in looking for a particular name and description using the `apropos` command. This will search the whatis database for files that have the specified string.

```
$ apropos search
```

## Conclusion

The article introduced the most frequently used command to search for files in linux. I hope you learned something new by reading this article,
and can now fully embrace the power of some the commands listed here. For more information on the commands there is the man pages which will provide more technical 
information. The `ls` command alone has over 70 options.
